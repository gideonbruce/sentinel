Domain module contains your business logic and use cases—the "what" and "why" of your app independent of any technology. It defines interfaces and logic for what your app actually does. For your emergency app, domain would have use cases like SendEmergencyAlertUseCase, DetectGestureUseCase, GetEmergencyContactsUseCase, and UpdateGestureSensitivityUseCase. These are plain Kotlin classes with no Android dependencies. Domain never knows about databases, APIs, or UI—it just knows the rules of your business logic.
