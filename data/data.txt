Data module handles all the technical details of storing and retrieving information. It's the "how" of data access. When your domain layer says "I need emergency contacts," the data layer figures out whether to fetch them from a local Room database, SharedPreferences, or a remote server. Data includes repositories (classes that coordinate between local and remote data sources), database setup, API clients, and data models. It implements the interfaces defined by domain, so domain says "I need this data" and data delivers it.
